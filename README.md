NodeJS Sandbox: MultiPong

## Possible improvements
- Out of bounds may happen when the angle or speed is too high and the walls are too thin. 
Current "fix" is simply having massive walls.

- Client side interpolation to remove network latency dependency.


## Ideas
- Random blocks appearing on the field, messing with the path of the ball.
